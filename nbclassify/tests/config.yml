# The directory hierarchy describes how images are organized on the local
# hard drive. Each item in the list corresponds to a rank name in the database.
# The directory name will be stored as the taxonomic name for that rank.
# If the directory name is "None", that rank will not be saved in the database.
# Directory levels can be ignored by setting the corresponding rank in the
# directory hierarchy to "__ignore__".
