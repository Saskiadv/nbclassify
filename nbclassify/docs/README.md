# Documentation

This directory contains [Sphinx][1] documentation.

To build the documentation, you first need to install the requirements. The
easiest way is to use the Python Package Index:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Then build the documentation with this command:

    make html

Open `_build/html/index.html` with your web browser to read the documentation.
